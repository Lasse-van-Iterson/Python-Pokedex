# Python Pokedex

## Introduction
Python Pokedex is a simple command-line application that allows users to search for information about Pokémon using the PokeAPI. Users can enter the name or ID of a Pokémon, and the program retrieves and displays various details about the Pokémon, such as its name, ID, height, weight, and types. Additionally, users hear Pokémon's sound. This is made as part of the weekly challenge by Sloth Bytes.

## Features
- Search for Pokémon by name or ID.
- Display detailed information about the Pokémon, including its name, ID, height, weight, and types.
- Listen to the sound of the Pokémon.

Python Pokedex requires the following dependencies:

- `pydub`: To play and manipulate sound files.
- `Pillow`: To process and convert images to suitable formats.
